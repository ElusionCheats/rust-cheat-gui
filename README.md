Welcome to the **Rust Cheat Menu**, a professional-grade **simulation of cheat-style game enhancement tools** for educational and development purposes. This project showcases the visual and structural components of common Rust hacks such as **Aimbot**, **ESP**, **Wallhack**, **No Recoil**, **TriggerBot**, and **Radar**, **without implementing any actual game modifications**.

---

## 🧠 What Is This Project?

The Rust Cheat menu is **not a real cheat**. Instead, it is a fully interactive **mock UI** that simulates how cheating software might look and function — helping game developers, anti-cheat researchers, UI designers, and ethical hackers understand and analyze illicit tool design.

Whether you're reverse engineering, building detection systems, or prototyping overlay interfaces, this tool offers a safe, legal sandbox for learning.

> ✅ **This is a simulated project. No game files are modified. Nothing is injected. 100% safe and legal.**

## 🎮 Rust Cheat Features (Visual-Only)

### 🎯 Aimbot UI
Mimics automated targeting controls, including toggle for head/torso locking, field of view (FOV) sliders, and aim smoothing settings. Provides insight into how real cheats implement user-defined targeting parameters.

### 🔍 ESP (Extrasensory Perception)
Visually replicates player box highlights, health bars, weapon icons, and distance meters through walls. Ideal for studying screen overlays and ESP rendering behavior without triggering anti-cheat systems.

### 🧱 Wallhack
Demonstrates how in-game objects and players might be artificially rendered through structures like walls and rocks. Fake visuals provide safe training for detection and overlay UX.

### ⚡ TriggerBot
Fake toggle for auto-fire logic when the crosshair aligns with a hostile player. Displays timing settings and hit-scan simulation, perfect for UI/UX testing and anti-cheat training exercises.

### 🎮 No Recoil
Simulated toggle to reduce weapon kickback. Does not change gameplay mechanics but visualizes how recoil manipulation is represented in a real cheat interface.

### 🛰️ Radar Hack
Creates a floating or fixed radar-style mini-map showing mock player positions, loot crates, and base layouts. A great example of 2D spatial tracking UI elements used by cheat developers.
